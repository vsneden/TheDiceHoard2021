## About the Hoard
This photo collection is a digital represenation of the physical dice collection that lives in my apartment. Of the 54 sets included in this collection, 49 of them are from my personal collection (pictured below) with the other 5 coming from my partner's collection. Not featured in this collection are the single extra dice that have come as bonuses when purchasing full dice sets, from jewelry, or just standalone purchases for a gimmick reason.

These dice sets are used to play Dungeons and Dragons (and other tabletop roleplaying games), and each set consists of 7 dice. The dice are named for the number of sides each die has, ranging from 4 to 20 sides. Pictured below (from left to right), is a d6, a d8, a d10, a d10 percentile, a d12, a d4, and a d20.

Almost every dice is used when you're playing a D&D game, but the most common dice is the d20, as that is what is used to determine if you hit enemies, spot traps, pet horses, and do pretty much everything in the game. 

## About the Collector
Hi all, my name is Tori and I am a self-confessed dice dragon/goblin. I personally started collecting dice in 2015 or so when my partner introduced me to the game of D&D and I knew immediately that I wanted to own as many pretty dice sets as possible. Fastforward a few years and my collection is now nearing 300 dice! I decided to make this the focus of my project for a few reasons - 1, I have a LOT of dice and having a digital catalogue/sorting method isn't the worst thing in the world, especially since it lets me track how many blue dice sets I have and how much I need to expand my color palette. Scrolling through Etsy to find gorgeous dice sets is honestly a highlight of my day some days and I'm hoping to break 500 dice by the end of 2022. Here's to lots of fun ventures in the future!
